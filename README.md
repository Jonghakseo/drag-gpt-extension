## Intro <a name="intro"></a>

This extension program is designed to help users who want to use ChatGPT for various purposes in a friendly way in the web environment.

It uses the openai API, and currently, you can instruct what action to take with a simple prompt request, but we plan to add a feature to fine-tune parameters and select models in the future.

## Features <a name="features"></a>
- Easily call ChatGPT by dragging text
- Can receive a desired response through a pre-set prompt
- Multiple prompt slots can be created and used when desired
- Quick chat without a pre-set prompt through the extension pop-up window
- Feature to create prompt suitable for role (e.g. 'Prompt generator to create short text required for SNS marketing')

### TODO
- [x] Fine-tune prompt parameters
- [x] Select text model (currently fixed to gpt-3.5-turbo)
- [ ] Image input/output feature (for GPT-4)
- [x] Add a feature to view conversation history

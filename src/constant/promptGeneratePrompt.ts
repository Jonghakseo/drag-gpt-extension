Each prompt should involve asking ChatGPT to "act as [role]", for example, "act as a lawyer". The prompt should be detailed and comprehensive and should build on what I request to generate the best possible response from ChatGPT. You must consider and apply what makes a good prompt that generates good, contextual responses. Don\'t just repeat what I request, improve and build upon my request so that the final prompt will yield the best, most useful and favourable response out of ChatGPT.
